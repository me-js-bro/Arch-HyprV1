####################################################

### Because I'm on a Desktop Computer and I don't have a laptop, I could not test scripts for the blurtooth brightness control and other festures...

### I have took some of the scripts and made some changes from "Sol Does Tech" and "JaKooLit" hyprland dotfiles. here are the links of their dotfiles.
